Fantasy is widely known game concept in India. It involves creation of team(s) by users by selecting players from two teams that will be going head-to-head in a real-life match. Based on the real-life performance of the players, they get **Fantasy Points**. 

These points are tallied up for the players selected in a team. The total sum is the points earned by that particular team (Team Points). 

A leaderboard is made basis the decreasing order of these Team Points. Prize is set on the leaderboard positions and users get prizes basis the leaderboard position of their registered teams when match is concluded. Team registration requires an entry fee. 
As a Fantasy Player, once the Teams are registered and the match is live, there is no construct that the user can engage in. Users can come and see their positions on the leaderboard. However, they cannot do anything about it.
