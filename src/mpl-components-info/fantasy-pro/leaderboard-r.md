**Approach**



* Idea was to build upon the existing leaderboard screen doing incremental changes to accommodate new information. Reason was that since this feature was to be developed in a limited amount of time and become part of the existing product ecosystem, major new constructs/patterns could not be introduced. 
* Dividing the whole screen into smaller sections and the primary UI component to be worked upon was the ‘Leaderboard Item’
