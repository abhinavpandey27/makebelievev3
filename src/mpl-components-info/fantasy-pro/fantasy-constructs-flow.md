To understand where the feature will come in the picture, it is essential to understand the existing Fantasy constructs. 

The bread and butter of the Fantasy product involves users registering their teams.

The basic team registration flow involves three simple steps (secondary and Tertiary Flows removed for brevity)



1. Choose a match
2. Choose a contest
3. Create and Register Team

Basis these steps, following are few constructs to keep in mind



1. **Registered Match:** Match where the user has registered with a Team. (For example: IND vs SL Match)
2. **Registered Contest:** Contest where the user has registered with their Team(s). (For example: Monster Contest, Grand Contest etc). NOTE: Users have the option to choose 1 or many contests and register with same or different teams. 
3. **Registered User in a Match:** User who has at least one team registered in one contest of a match.

This feature, in the Version 1, was for Registered users only.
