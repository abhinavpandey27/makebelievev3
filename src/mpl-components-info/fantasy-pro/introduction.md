Based on the real-life performance of the players in the real-life match, they get Fantasy Points. These points are tallied up for the players selected by users in their teams. The sum of these player points are the points earned by that particular team (Team Points).

The construct of **Fantasy Pro** comes in this place. _It offers a chance to the user to engage, as the match is live._
