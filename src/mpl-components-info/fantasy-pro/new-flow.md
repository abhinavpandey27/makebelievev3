Since the Flows are incredibly detailed and complex and something that I didn’t own, the case study won’t delve into the details of flows. For better understanding, you may reach out to me and I will help understand the flows better.

To keep it short, I will explain generally where the new things were to be added and connect it with the screens that I had to own. \
 \
**Fantasy Homepage:** A pop-up with an autoplay video was set in motion to explain the feature to the users. 

**My Matches:** To create excitement and improve engagement, the Trades count (the amount of trades that happened + happening right now) were to be shown.

**Joined Contest Screen:** On this Screen the joined contests were shown under the Live Scorecard. As the Fantasy Pro feature came into the picture, this became a really important screen from where the user journeys will start. 

**Leaderboard Screen:** Screen where the users will see their teams, teams they have bid on and also all the teams on the leaderboard.

**Filters/Filter Screen:** Component on the Leaderboard using which users can narrow down their teams and subsequent screens where users can see their filter results and take actions accordingly.

**My Bids Screen:** Screen where users can see the teams they have bid on.

**My Trades Screen:** Screen where users have a top-level view on how their trades are faring out or have fared out.

**Buy/Sell Screen:** Screens where the primary actions concerning the trades happen.
