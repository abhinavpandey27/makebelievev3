The wireframes and the flows of the feature were owned by Tapan (Senior Designer) and Winy and Vansh (Product Managers) on the team. My role was to ensure conversion of the wireframes into the final pixel perfect production ready user interfaces. Hence, the case study wonâ€™t go into the details of the flow. 

Once with the wireframes in my hand, I went on to create the designs ensuring their compliance with our Design System - VDS (Vector Design System).
