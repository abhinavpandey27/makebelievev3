To describe these designs with the same specificity and analogy that a coffee taster might use, I get a friendly feeling from SoDo Sans. It doesn't try to be mathematically literal, or overly systematic, its various decisions produce a charming result that performs well in context. In the same way that picking up the phone and hearing 'it's me' connects a voice we're familiar with to a person in our heads, SoDo Sans plays the role of 'corporate identity sans serif' with enough differentiation that a customer can say 'ah yes, hello Starbucks' when they see this typographic voice in an advertisement or menu.
