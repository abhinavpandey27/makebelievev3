Ease of maintenance tips the scales in favor of Airtable over individual markdown files, and especially for this project since it already exists in Airtable. I have an Airtable form to add new datasets, and as I mentioned above Iâ€™ll set up a daily build at Netlify using either [IFTTT](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/quicktips/netlify-ifttt/) or [Zapier](https://zapier.com/apps/netlify/integrations/schedule/29330/start-deploys-of-netlify-sites-on-a-daily-schedule) to pick up any added datasets.
